# pose-tools
This is a blender addon which hosts a few tools for improving and extending the use of the blender pose library for character animation.

The source for this code is available at [https://github.com/TheDuckCow/pose-tools](https://github.com/TheDuckCow/pose-tools), developed by [Patrick W. Crawford](http://www.theduckcow.com)

[See this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT7-IlVgIw0) of the addon for example uses.

# Functions/operators
- **Apply Mixed Pose**: Apply a percentage mix between the current pose and the selected library pose.
- **Mixed Paste Pose**: Apply a percentage mix between the current pose and the previously copied pose
- For both tools: *Slider in the redo-last menu is for interactive changing of the pose, slider in the animation tab is for pre-setting the mix percentage but you can still use the redo-last menu slider.*

*Mixed Pose (library)*

# Planned
- **Limited Add Pose**: *(planned)* Create a new pose based only on position of selected bones. The default behavior is a new pose will store a keyframe for all bone channels, selected/visible or not.
- **Sync-linked Pose Lib**: *(planned)* If a pose library is linked or appended, auto or manually resync it with updated poses if the external pose library changed.

# Addon goals
- Create a tool that easily mixes library poses with current poses
- Allow easy and more direct library linking/accessing of external pose libraries
- Improve the ease and clarify of use of the library pose tools
