# pose-tools
This is a blender addon which hosts a few tools for improving and extending the use of the blender pose library for character animation.

# Addon goals
- Create a tool that easily mixes library poses with current poses
- Allow easy and more direct library linking/accessing of external pose libraries

# Todo list
- Extract current pose on a per-bone basis
- Figure out how to show values in the post-operator panel
